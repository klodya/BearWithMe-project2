Having a hard time making decisions? 
Seeking answers for questions you did not ask?
Do you love bears?! Who doesn't! Seek no further my friend.
 
The Bear With Me app offers you an array of delightful predictions with absolutely no connection to your most meaningful questions! And for a limited time only, Bear With Me comes with an all inclusive FREE “smart” bear to answer all your questions with unrelated but truly fascinating facts about trees.
Don’t stop there! Improve your predictions by feeding the bear (and/or getting him drunk)! Get more for you questions by giving the bear a tasty treat, or a swig from his favourite beverage. Don’t miss out on getting the answer you deserve!

Bear With Me is currently available for free when you subscribe to our mailing list. What are you waiting for? Get in touch today and you will be automatically entered in our prize draw to win a whole real live bear!
